// This function does "whatever needs to be done" as a result of receiving a
// CMDU: for example, some CMDU trigger a response, others are used to update
// the topology data base, etc...
//
// This function does *not* deal with "discarding" or "forwarding" the packet
// (that should have already been taken care of before this function is called)
//
// 'c' is the just received CMDU structure.
//
// 'receiving_interface_addr' is the MAC address of the local interface where
// the CMDU packet was received
//
// 'src_addr' is the MAC address contained in the 'src' field of the ethernet
// frame which contained the just received CMDU payload.
//
// 'queue_id' is the ID of the queue where messages to the AL entity should be
// posted in case new actions are derived from the processing of the current
// message.
//
// Return values:
//   PROCESS_CMDU_KO:
//     There was problem processing the CMDU
//   PROCESS_CMDU_OK:
//     The CMDU was correctly processed. No further action required.
//   PROCESS_CMDU_OK_TRIGGER_AP_SEARCH:
//     The CMDU was correctly processed. The caller should now trigger an "AP
//     search" process if there is still an unconfigured AP local interface.
