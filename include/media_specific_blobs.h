// The 1905 standard originally only recognized a limited set of interface
// types (IEEE802.11, IEEE802.3, IEEE1901, MOCA, ...) and for each of these
// types some parameters were defined (for example, the "bssid" and other
// things for IEEE802.11 interfaces, the "networ).
//
// Later, the standard was expanded to accept arbitrary parameters from all
// types of interfaces. This is done by using the next structure.

// Main API functions
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// This function receives a pointer to a "genericInterfaceType" structure and
// then allocates and returns a buffer holding the array of bytes that should
// be inserted in the 1905 "media_specific" fields present in several TLVs
// ("generic phy device information TLV", "push button generic phy event
// notification TLV" and "power off interface TLV").
//
// This function "translates" the "genericInterfaceType" structure fields
// specific for each supported interface type into a stream of bytes according
// to the corresponding standard that applies to each particular type of
// interface.
//
// The returned pointer can later be free with "free_media_specific_blob()"
//
// 'len' is an output argument that holds the length of the returned buffer.
//
