# Description: This script is an example of how to start the 1905 stack in a
#              Linksys 1900 AC device
#
#              The following binaries/scripts must be in the same directory :
#                   - start_linksys.sh
#                   - topology_change.sh
#                   - al_entity
#                   - configlayer
#
#              This script will :
#                   - configure the WIFI radio 1 with default configuration
#                   - configure the ebtables to drop 1905 multicast MACs
#                   - start the topology_change.sh script to monitor topology
#                     changes and inform 1905 stack
#                   - start the 1905 stack with the default configuration
#
#              This script must be run with the following command :
#                   - ./start_linksys.sh
#
