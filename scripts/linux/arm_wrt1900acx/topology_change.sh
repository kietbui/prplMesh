# Description: This script is in charge of monitoring network topology changes
#              and inform the 1905 stack that a new device has been connected
#              or a device has been disconnected.
#
#              This script is automatically started by the 'start_linksys.sh'
#              script.
#
#              In this example, the script only monitors GHN and WIFI
#              interfaces. If something occurs in these two interfaces,
#              a "touch" will be done to the /tmp/topology_change file to
#              inform the 1905 stack that the topology must be refreshed.
